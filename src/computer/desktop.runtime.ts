/**
 * Offline/development fallback for Bimax Computer Use.
 *
 * On macOS this is a small in-repo Swift helper (helper.source.ts), compiled once with the system
 * toolchain and cached under ~/.bimax/native by source hash. Degradation ladder when swiftc is
 * absent: cliclick → AppleScript System Events. On Linux the fallback is xdotool. Shipped builds
 * normally use BimaxComputerRuntime below, backed by the pinned native sidecar.
 *
 * Coordinate contract: everything is GLOBAL SCREEN POINTS. Retina screenshots are downscaled to
 * point resolution before the model sees them, so "click where the pixel is" is always correct.
 * click/move/drag/scroll also accept the 0–1000 normalized space VLMs emit (Gemini convention),
 * scaled against the main display.

Repeated generic controls may be enriched with their row context (for example, "Show Detail — Battery Health"); choose that exact control and never click structural containers such as Window, Sidebar, Outline, Group, or Scroll Area. Set sliders with set_value on their fresh semantic handle: maximum/full/100% maps to 1 and minimum/mute/0% maps to 0; never click or drag a slider to approximate an exact value. A visible modal, sheet, dialog, or popover blocks the page behind it: interact only with that foreground surface and, after reading it, dismiss it with Done, Close, Cancel, or Escape before navigating or scrolling the underlying page. Dismissing a blocker does not complete the interrupted navigation: retry the original action.
