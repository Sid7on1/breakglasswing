/**
 * Replay harness (BiMax v2, Phase 4 — the divergence-report consumer).
 *
 * Re-drives a REAL AgentLoop over a recorded episode: LLM responses come from the
 * bundle's ReplayProvider, tool calls are answered from the recorded tool results
 * (side-effect-free — nothing executes), and the learning observers stand down.
 *
 * What that measures: with an unchanged harness the re-run is deterministic — every
 * request hash matches its recording and the report says IDENTICAL (the determinism
 * gate). After a harness change (system prompt, context assembly, sanitizer, tool
 * surface), the first request whose hash no longer matches is the exact point where
 * the change alters the agent's trajectory — an eval on recorded traffic at zero
 * token cost, which is D5's whole demand.
