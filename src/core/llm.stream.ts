 *  - `implicit: false` — stream visible text from the first token. Correct for:
 *      • plainContent models (never reason inline), and
 *      • native out-of-band reasoners (reasoning arrives on `reasoning_content`; content is answer), and
 *      • OPENER-based inline reasoners (step-3.7): their reasoning is always wrapped `<think>…</think>`,
 *        which the explicit filter path hides, so a tag-free answer can stream immediately.
 *  - `implicit: true` — buffer the leading region until a `</think>` closer (or the bounded cap, or a
 *      tool call) resolves it. Required ONLY for OPENER-LESS reasoners and for UNKNOWN models, where
 *      un-tagged leading text is genuinely ambiguous between reasoning and answer.
 *
 * `capBounded` says whether the implicit buffer is bounded (the "bounded hybrid"): true until the
 * model is a CONFIRMED reasoner (table-seeded or runtime-detected), after which the cap lifts so long
 * opener-less CoT isn't sliced and leaked before its closer. Ignored when `implicit` is false.
