/**
 * Model capability layer.
 *
 * BiMax is model-agnostic: one OpenAI-compatible seam (`LlmAdapter`) drives NVIDIA, OpenAI,
 * Anthropic, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Google and local endpoints. A handful of powerful features
 * only exist on *some* models — prompt caching (Anthropic), structured/JSON-schema outputs
 * (OpenAI, Gemini), reliable parallel tool calls, native reasoning channels, vision input.
 *
 * Rather than assume one provider and bolt the rest on, BiMax declares each power as a
 * **capability flag** and resolves the flags for the *currently selected* model. Callers then
 * light up a native fast-path when the capability is present and fall back to a universal path
 * (which BiMax already ships for most of these) when it is not. The golden rule:
 *
 *   The conservative FLOOR (everything off) must reproduce today's behavior byte-for-byte.
 *   A capability only ever *adds* an optimization; it never removes a fallback.
 *
 * Resolution is a curated table, not runtime probing: probing costs a request and is flaky,
 * whereas a table keyed by well-known model-id substrings is deterministic and free. The long
 * tail (a proxy that secretly supports caching, a self-hosted vision model) is covered by an
 * explicit override (`BGW_CAP_*` env or config), so nothing is permanently locked off.
