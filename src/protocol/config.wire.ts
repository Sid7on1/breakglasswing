/**
 * The settings surface behind protocol v3's `configGet` / `configSet`.
 *
 * This is the silent path a graphical front-end uses instead of driving transcript menus, and it
 * exists as its own module for one reason: it has to be testable without booting a container.
 *
 * The bug it was extracted to prevent — a settings screen that verifies the wrong thing:
 *
 *   `configSet` used to `saveConfig(patch)` and then answer with the config FILE. The file had
 *   genuinely changed, so the front-end's read-back compared its own request against its own
 *   request and reported "applied" every time. But `LlmAdapter` caches the model slots at boot
 *   (`userModel` / `defaultModel`), and nothing here ever told it. Every other write path —
 *   `/model` (cli/commands/meta.ts), `/config set` (cli/commands/builtins.ts), ModelTool — follows
 *   its save with an `applyConfig`. This one did not, so the desktop's model picker changed the
 *   file, said it worked, and every request kept going to the model loaded at startup.
 *
 * Two invariants follow, and both are pinned by `src/__tests__/config.wire.test.ts`:
 *
 *   1. A write that touches an adapter-owned key MUST reach the adapter.
 *   2. A read MUST report the adapter's loaded state for those keys, not the file's — so when the
 *      two disagree, the front-end sees the disagreement instead of a false success.

/**
