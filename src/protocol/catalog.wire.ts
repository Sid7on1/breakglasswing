/**
 * The provider + model catalogue behind protocol `catalogGet` / `providerSet`.
 *
 * Why this exists as a wire message rather than a static list in the front-end: a model id is only
 * meaningful against a provider. The curated catalogue in cli/models.ts is a *recommendation*,
 * while the provider's `/models` endpoint is what will actually be accepted, and the two disagree
 * constantly (NVIDIA lists ids it then 404s; a rotated catalogue silently orphans a saved pin).
 * A picker built from either one alone is wrong in a way the user cannot see, so both cross the
 * wire and the front-end shows the difference.
 *
 * Credential rule, enforced here rather than trusted to callers: a key value NEVER leaves this
 * module. `hasKey`, `keyCount`, and a 4-character display tail are the only things reported.
