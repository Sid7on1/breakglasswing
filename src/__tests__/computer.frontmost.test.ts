/**
 * Which authority answers "who is frontmost?".
 *
 * This is the activation-confirmation probe: every target switch calls it, and the wait for an app
 * to come forward polls it. Measured on a real machine, the two available authorities cost 642ms
 * (the sidecar enumerating every running application) and 4ms (the native helper reading
 * NSWorkspace) for the same answer — so the choice of authority was most of a target switch, and at
 * 642ms per probe a "poll every 40ms" loop could only ever take one sample.
 *
 * These assert the ORDER and its guard rail, not any timing number: the cheap authority is asked
 * first, and only when it exists already — resolving it must never drag a first-use `swiftc`
 * compile onto the critical path.
