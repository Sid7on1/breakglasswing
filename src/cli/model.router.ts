/**
 * Model-tier routing. Two slots are configured: the QUICK model (fast, cheap — for chat and
 * trivially-answerable turns) and the WORK coding model (the user's chosen main model).
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE (2026-07-18 — replaces the remote pre-flight classifier):
 * Routing is now FULLY LOCAL and deterministic. Seven architectures were compared before this
 * design was chosen (docs/ROUTING_DECISION.md has the measured comparison):
 *
 *   1. Serial remote classification (the old design) — a non-streaming lite-model round-trip
 *      cost ~1.17s of first-token latency per ambiguous turn, measured against a 120ms mock;
 *      against real NIM it was the single largest local latency source after the key-cooldown
 *      bug was fixed.
 *   2. Parallel classification + main-call preparation — already partially in place (routing
 *      overlapped @-mention expansion); the turn was still blocked on the slowest leg, the
 *      classifier itself. Ceiling: ~150ms saved.
 *   3. Local deterministic routing for obvious cases — existed (heuristicTier); extended here.
 *   4. Local classifier + remote fallback — the remote leg re-introduces the exact tail latency
 *      being removed, on exactly the turns that hit it. Rejected.
 *   5. Optimistic Quick with escalation — serves real work from the weak model first (observed
 *      live: the quick model flails on tool loops), then pays double latency+cost to escalate.
 *      Rejected: quality-unsafe in the failure direction that matters.
 *   6. Default Work with later adaptation — correctness-safe: the Work model handles everything
 *      the Quick model can, so a misroute in this direction costs tokens, never quality.
 *      ADOPTED as the ambiguity default.
 *   7. Capability-driven routing — the informative capability signals (will this turn need
 *      tools/repo context?) are visible in the prompt locally: file paths, @mentions, code
 *      fences, repo-referring nouns, imperative verbs. ADOPTED as the signal set for the local
 *      classifier; mid-turn model switching was rejected as a separate, riskier change.
 *
 * What the old remote classifier handled correctly is preserved deterministically:
 *   - short imperatives outside HEAVY_VERB ("please rework the tokenizer") → Work, via the
 *     general-imperative detector (the old shape fallback misrouted these to Quick at <140 chars);
 *   - repo-referring questions ("what does the governor do here") → Work, via the repo-signal
 *     detector (answering requires reading code);
 *   - genuinely self-contained knowledge questions ("what's the difference between let and
 *     const?") → Quick, via the knowledge-question detector.
 * What it produced that is deliberately dropped: the one-line "task brief" (optional framing —
 * the Work model always received the user's original prompt anyway).
