    description: `Spawns an asynchronous, parallel sub-agent (own worker, own context window) to handle a delegated task.

Use it when work can genuinely run in parallel (independent sub-tasks across disjoint files) or when a big exploration would flood your own context. Do NOT use it for small sequential steps — doing those yourself is faster than a spawn round-trip.

# How to spawn well
- **Self-contained prompt:** The sub-agent boots with a BLANK memory — no conversation history, no idea what the user said. Its prompt must carry everything: the goal, relevant file paths, constraints, what "done" looks like, and what to report back.
- **Disjoint scopes:** Give each parallel sibling a \`scope\` that doesn't overlap the others (overlaps are flagged, not blocked). Two agents on the same files = wasted, conflicting work.
- **Worktree when editing in parallel:** Set \`isolation: "worktree"\` whenever the sub-agent will EDIT files while siblings run — each gets its own git worktree + branch, so they can never clobber each other. Read-only agents don't need it.
- **Model:** By default the sub-agent inherits your model. Pass \`model\` to run it on a different one (e.g. a cheaper/faster model for bulk mechanical work, a heavier one for a gnarly refactor).
- **Asynchronous:** You get \`TASK_QUEUED\` immediately. The result is posted into the conversation as a system message when the agent finishes — it is NOT injected mid-turn. Finish your current turn; the result will be waiting. Don't spin-wait or re-spawn the same task.`,
