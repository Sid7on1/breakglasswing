 * Blueprint in sketch mode the agent can switch itself to beast mode and build it; if it realizes
 * mid-build it needs to rethink, it can switch back to sketch. The user can always override.
 *
 * Switching to explore/sketch flips the read-only gate (the agent's own writes get blocked);
 * switching to code/beast/general restores writes — so the agent is choosing its own permissions,
 * which is the point. The governor still gates individual destructive actions in interactive mode.

  description: `Switch your own behavioral mode (the same modes the user cycles with Shift+Tab). Use this to drive the workflow yourself instead of waiting to be told.

# Modes
- **explore**: read-only reconnaissance — writes blocked. Use to map an unfamiliar codebase first.
- **sketch**: interactive architect — discuss an idea and build a level-by-level Blueprint (writes blocked except Blueprint/Plan files). Use when the user describes something to build.
- **code**: execution focus — surgical edits, verify after. Writes allowed.
- **beast**: autonomous builder — drive a goal or a saved Blueprint to a verified result (mega-pipeline, training config + monitoring). Writes allowed.
- **general**: default, no specialization.

# When to switch yourself
- Finished a Blueprint in sketch mode and the user is ready → switch to **beast** and build it.
- The build reveals the plan was wrong → switch back to **sketch** to rework it with the user.
- Asked to "just look / don't change anything" → switch to **explore**.
Always pass a short reason. Tell the user which mode you switched to and why. Prefer to confirm with the user before self-promoting from a read-only mode (sketch/explore) into a write mode (code/beast) if the change is large or risky.`,
