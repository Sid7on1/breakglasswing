Either every edit applies or none do — use this for coordinated refactors (e.g. rename a symbol across files, change a signature and its callers) instead of many separate EditFileTool calls.

# Instructions
- Provide an \`edits\` array. Each entry: { path, oldString, newString, replaceAll? }.
- Each \`oldString\` must match its file exactly (whitespace included) and be unique unless \`replaceAll: true\`.
- Multiple edits to the same file are applied in array order; write later edits against the result of earlier ones.
- If ANY edit fails validation, the whole batch is rejected and no file is modified.`,
  // Governance is enforced per-file inside execute, so the factory wrapper stays out of the way.
