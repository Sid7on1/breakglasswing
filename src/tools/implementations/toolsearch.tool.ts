/**
 * ToolSearchTool — bimax's deferred-tool loader (smart context mode).
 *
 * In smart mode only the core working-set of tools is sent to the model each turn; rarer/heavier
 * tools and every MCP tool are *deferred* — announced by name but not given full schemas. When a
 * task needs one, the model calls ToolSearchTool with a name or keyword; this resolves the matching
 * deferred tools, marks them discovered in the registry (so their real schemas are sent on the next
 * turn and become callable), and returns their definitions as text so the model sees the parameters.
 *
 * Loop prevention: when a model calls ToolSearchTool for a tool it already loaded (discovered),
 * the old response "No deferred tools matched" confused it into retrying with different keywords.
 * Now we detect this and explicitly tell the model the tool is already callable — do not retry.
 *
 * This tool is itself never deferred, and in 'full' context mode it is simply not sent.

Some tools are not sent to you up front to keep the context small — they appear by NAME only in the "LOAD-ON-DEMAND TOOLS" list (and all MCP tools are deferred). You cannot call a deferred tool until you load it here first.

Query forms:
- "select:GraphQueryTool,WebFetchTool" — load these exact tools by name.
- "search the web" / "mcp filesystem" — keyword search; the best-matching deferred tools are loaded.

After you call this, the matched tools' schemas are returned to you AND become available to call directly on your next step. Only load a deferred tool when a task actually needs it.
