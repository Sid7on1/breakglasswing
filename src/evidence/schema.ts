// Bimax causal evidence vocabulary — the shared cross-product contract for owner sections 28/29
// (V28B, V29B; see docs/product-reset/11_SECTIONS_28_29_RESEARCH_AND_DELIVERY_PLAN.md §2.2 and
// §10 slice S28-A step 1).
//
// This file is the SOURCE OF TRUTH and is mirrored verbatim into the Desktop app by
// `npm run gen:app-protocol` (drift gate: `npm run check:protocol-mirror`). It must therefore stay
// dependency-free and pure: no `node:` imports, no filesystem, no crypto, no engine types. Hashing,
// persistence and redaction *policy sources* live on each side of the boundary; the vocabulary,
// the canonical serialization and the honesty invariants live here so both products agree on what
// a piece of evidence means and when it is inadmissible.
//
// Two rules from the research shape almost every type below and are enforced, not documented:
//
//   1. "An evidence gap, dropped event or unavailable sensor cannot produce an unqualified safe
//      verdict" (08_ACCEPTANCE_GATES.md, section 28 gate). A Verification therefore carries
//      `satisfied: boolean | null` and `null` is the *required* value when the observation backing
//      it is incomplete or stale. There is no way to spell "safe, but we did not look".
//   2. "A lower level cannot waive a higher-level denial … no model-only block" (§2.3, §6). The
//      detection layer that produced a Decision bounds the disposition it is allowed to carry, in
//      both directions: a model may not block, and a deterministic hard floor may not be softened
//      into an advisory by anything that ran later.
