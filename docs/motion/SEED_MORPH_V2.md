# Seed Morph v2 — what was built

The brief is in [SEED_MORPH_BRIEF.md](SEED_MORPH_BRIEF.md); what BiMAX actually is, and what v1
already did, is in [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md). This file is the implementation: what changed, why, and
what has been measured rather than assumed.

## The one architectural change

**v1 was a FLIP.** The destination was laid out at final size, inverted onto the seed with a
transform, and played to identity. Beautiful compositing, two defects that cannot be patched:

1. `border-radius` resolves *before* the transform, so a 22px corner on a box scaled by (0.07, 0.4)
   paints as a 1.5×9px ellipse. The corner could not be interpolated honestly — which is why v1
   hard-coded `999px → 22px` and let it distort.
2. Content had to be counter-scaled to survive, and a counter-scale is a resample.

**v2 animates the box's real geometry** — `x, y, width, height, radius` as five retargetable springs
on a `position: fixed`, `contain: layout paint` shell, with the content laid out once at destination
size and merely clipped by the growing shell. This is what Prompt 1 §13 asks for literally: *morph
the container geometry, then reveal destination content within that geometry*.

Three things fall out of that choice for free:

- **Corner-anchoring** (§6). With `x` and `width` as independent springs, a seed left of its
  destination has a left edge that travels 200px while its right edge travels 660px. The near edge
  stays hooked to the source without a rule saying so. Under centre+scale both edges move
  symmetrically and the effect has to be faked with `transform-origin`.
- **Honest radius** (§7). It is a number in px, so it interpolates. Measured: 22 → 14 with a maximum
  step of 1.21px per frame.
- **No counter-scale on the morph path.** Text is rendered at its final size on frame one.

`components/ui/motion.ts` (the spring → CSS `linear()` compiler) is **unchanged and still in use**.
It is the right tool wherever the destination is known at launch and never moves — press, hover,
selection, fades — because the browser composites the whole flight on the GPU and it keeps playing
through a main-thread stall. Prompt 1 §36: *do not create duplicate animation systems*. Only the
morph moved.

## Why the spring is analytic

The usual implementation steps `v += a·dt; x += v·dt`. That is *conditionally stable*: at the
stiffnesses here (up to ~620) it needs `dt` under ~88ms, and a single stalled frame past that makes
the spring **gain** energy. In an app that stalls the main thread to render streaming markdown, that
failure is routine and looks like a panel flinging itself off screen after a hitch.

The closed-form solution of a damped harmonic oscillator has no such limit. `step()` is exact for any
`dt`. Pinned in `morph.spring.test.ts` by the invariant an unstable integrator breaks — total energy
`½k·x² + ½v²` never increases — across stalls of 50ms, 200ms, 500ms, 1s and 4s. Stepping once by
100ms and sixty times by 1.67ms land on the same value to four decimal places.

## Springs

Every morph token sits at **ζ ≥ 0.82**. v1's morph used ζ 0.70, which overshoots ~12% on a control.
Prompt 2 §6 governs: this is a pointer-driven Mac app whose controls get clicked hundreds of times a
session, and an overshoot you notice on the first click is one you resent by the hundredth. Measured
overshoot at ζ 0.82 over 300px of travel: **under 5px**. Present as a settle, absent as a bounce.

`dismiss` is critically damped and stiffer than any opening token — an overshoot on close means the
panel briefly gets *bigger* after the user asked it to go away.

Grading (`gradeSpring`): ζ climbs toward critical and stiffness falls as the surface grows, because
overshoot is perceived as a *fraction* of the surface. The distance term is deliberately small —
12% more time over the longest travel. Prompt 1 §29 asks for distance to matter; Prompt 2 §8 caps
how much it may.

## What was measured, not assumed

All from the running harness with the real components.

**A flight** (bottom-right pill → popover, 500px of travel):

| | value |
|---|---|
| first frame | `761, 680.4, 44×44, r22` — the seed, exactly |
| radius | 22 → 14, max step **1.21px/frame** |
| max position step | 55px/frame |
| max width step | 33px/frame |
| material | thickness 5px → 7px, elevation 0.16 → 0.72 |
| deformation at speed | **1.002 / 1.005**, peak 2.6% (cap 3%) |

**The reverse morph** lands on the pill within **0.1px on every dimension**
(`650.7, 386.5, 151.3×26.3` against the pill's `650.8, 386.4, 151.2×26.3`), unmounts cleanly, and
Escape returns focus to the trigger.

**Frame pacing** under a synthetic main-thread load of 6ms every 16ms (Prompt 2 §85): median
**16.6ms**, p95 22ms, max 22.7ms, **zero frames over 33ms**. Animating real `width`/`height` on a
contained fixed element holds 60fps while the main thread is a third occupied.

**Reduce Motion**: total travel **15.2px** instead of ~130px, a real 94% → 100% geometry transition
rather than an appear, no overshoot, and the launch box still leans toward the seed. Prompt 2 §32
asks for continuity to survive, not for the animation to be switched off.

**Placement**: every window size in the test matrix (720×500 → 2560×1440, plus 1440×320 and 380×900)
× five seed corners × every destination kind, asserted inside its window in
`morph.geometry.test.ts` and drawn to scale in the Lab's placement matrix.

**Interruption**: close at 10/30/70%, reopen mid-close, A→B, resize mid-flight, and a seed that moved
or vanished while the surface was open — all in `morph.controller.test.ts`, which steps the driver
frame by frame because it has no timeline to wait on. The invariant behind them is asserted
directly: **no frame may teleport**, however the flight is interrupted.

## Defects found and fixed during validation

1. **Ghost surfaces.** Changing a surface's `kind` rebuilt its controller, and `dispose()` cannot
   unmount its own element — leaving a frozen surface in the DOM with nothing driving it. Measured
   in the Lab: two ghosts with every seed reporting `aria-expanded="false"`. Fixed by making `kind`
   a getter so the controller outlives every prop change, plus dropping a mounted surface whose
   controller never opened (its `close()` is a no-op, so the unmount callback was never coming).
2. **Dead space in menus.** A menu is exactly as tall as its rows; a fixed 280px popover holding
   160px of content reads as the animation having overshot. Added `fitHeight` — two pure placement
   passes and one layout read at open, because height must be measured at the real width.
3. **Readouts styled as disabled controls.** The loaded-model rows are the reason to open the model
   menu, and `disabled` drew the answer faintest — at the edge of legible in light mode.
   `SeedMenuReadout` states rather than acts: full contrast, no focus, no hover.

## Golden flow 2 — a control becoming the inspector (Phase G)

The second flow is not a bigger popover, and the interesting half is not the flight. Prompt 2 §46
and §47: *during* the transition a sidebar or inspector is a growing structural region, and *after*
it settles it is part of window layout and leaves the overlay. A surface that stays on the overlay
is a floating card that happens to be docked — its splitter does nothing and it sits above the
title bar.

`MorphRegion` does it without duplicating the destination's React tree, which matters because the
inspector holds live sessions, an xterm and a diff view; mounting a second copy for the duration of
a flight would double every effect it runs. Instead:

- the **region** is in the layout at its real width from the first frame, so neighbours reflow once
  and nothing swims (§77);
- an empty **glass shell** flies from the seed to the region's *measured* box — measured, not
  computed, because the real one is wherever the user dragged the splitter to, and measuring gets
  its real corner radius for free so nothing pops at the handoff;
- the region is **clipped to the shell's live geometry** and crossfaded in behind it, so the content
  is revealed by the growing container (§12, §13) rather than fading in beside it;
- at settle the shell unmounts and every driven style is *cleared*, not reset to a resting value.

Measured in the harness, through the real React path — open: shell mounted, region clipped to
`inset(19px 174.51px 238px 66.88px round 8px)` at opacity 0, the 8px being the trigger's own corner;
settled: **0 overlays**, region inline style **empty**; closing: shell back, `inset(0px)` at opacity
1, contracting; closed: region unmounted. `morph.region.test.ts` grades the frames in between —
the exposed rect equals shell ∩ region on every frame, the reveal never runs backwards, no inset is
ever negative, and the region empties *before* it contracts.

Both bars are on it (`App.tsx`), seeded from the intent tracker — so the inspector grows out of the
lane chip, the composer control, the dock or the title-bar toggle without any of them knowing about
it, and materialises in place when the engine raises it with nobody having pressed anything (§45).

## Migration (Phase I) — v1 is gone

Every surface is on v2 and `ui/seed-expand.tsx` has been deleted along with `ui/dropdown.tsx`. There
is one motion system again (§36):

| Surface | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Model, task type, permission level, quality | `Dropdown` | `SeedMenu` |
| Appearance (title bar), branch switcher | `Dropdown` | `SeedMenu` |
| Seven dialogs, incl. the command palette | Radix + FLIP | Radix + morph driver |
| Mac timeline detail | `SeedPanel` | `SeedPopover` |
| Sidebar, inspector | `SeedRegion` | `MorphRegion` |

Two defects fell out of doing it, both invisible at 60fps:

1. **Radix's Portal renders `null` on its first commit**, so the commit that opens a dialog is one
   where its nodes do not exist. `resolve()` found nothing to measure and the destination fell back
   to a default — a 560×624 sheet holding 197px of content, flying smoothly to the wrong size. The
   driver now re-measures when its elements arrive; retargeting makes it invisible, because the
   springs are nowhere near the target one frame in. After the fix the same dialog settles at
   420×236 — its declared width, its content's height.
2. **`open()` on an already-open surface re-announced its own arrival.** `onSettled` is what moves
   focus into a menu and what tells a region to leave the overlay, so a spurious one yanks focus back
   to the first row under the user's hands. It now returns early when nothing has moved.

## Native chrome (Phase E)

| §  | Behaviour | How |
|---|---|---|
| §15 | `appearsActive` | Electron `focus`/`blur` → `data-window-active` on `<html>`; decorations ease off, never content |
| §14, §89 | User accent colour | `systemPreferences.getAccentColor()` → `--accent-system`, null when the platform has none |
| §30 | Reduce Transparency | `@media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce)` — veils go opaque, lens bands removed |
| §31 | Increase Contrast | `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` — borders, quiet text and focus rings at the token |
| §22 | Toolbar priority tiers | `ui/toolbar.tsx`: measured overflow, not breakpoints |

The two accessibility settings are read straight from Chromium rather than plumbed over IPC, and
both media queries were checked to actually *parse* in this Electron before being relied on — an
unsupported query is not an error, it is a block that silently never applies. Key-window state has
no CSS in Chromium (`:window-inactive` is WebKit's), so that one is plumbed.

The toolbar took three passes and each failure is worth keeping:

1. It was `shrink-0`, so the row was never squeezed and never learned it was short of room — the
   pressure landed on the project name instead.
2. Made shrinkable, it demoted exactly one tier and stopped: the observer only fires when the row's
   box changes, and demoting a tier that holds nothing changes nothing. It now re-measures on its
   own `depth`, which converges and terminates on React's bail-out.
3. Flex distributes a deficit *proportionally*, so the row kept losing its share after there was
   nothing left to demote — slicing 6px off the overflow button itself. Its floor is now its own
   content once everything demotable is demoted.

Honest result: at the app's real minimum window width (`minWidth: 720`) the tiers never need to
fire, even with a deep project path and a 51-character branch name, because the branch chip is
capped at 220px. The mechanism is verified where it does fire (458px, below any reachable window)
and nothing clips at any width. It exists so the next toolbar item is a priority decision rather
than a layout emergency.

## Not done

- **`liveMorphCount()` has no production consumer** — it exists so the test lane can assert nothing
  is left running.
- **The morph is not exercised by an automated DOM test.** The controller, the geometry and the
  region's paint are graded frame by frame in the node lane; everything about mounting, portals and
  the handoff is verified by driving the real components in `design-preview` and reading the DOM
  back. That is how both defects above were found, and it is a manual step.
- **Phase H's live-app pass.** Every claim here was measured in the browser harness with the real
  components, not in a running Electron window: this session's browser pane could not paint, so
  there are no screenshots and no by-eye check at 0.25×. The geometry, the handoff and the tiers are
  measured; *how it looks* is not yet re-confirmed for the newly migrated surfaces.
