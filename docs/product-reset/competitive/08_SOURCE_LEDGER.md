# Competitive source ledger

Accessed 2026-08-08 unless noted. First-party sources are preferred. Product documentation changes
quickly; re-open every source before publishing an external comparison.

## Bimax evidence read

- `docs/product-reset/01_CURRENT_REPO_AUDIT.md`
- `docs/product-reset/08_ACCEPTANCE_GATES.md`

- `docs/INFRA_2026_BACKLOG.md`
- `docs/FEATURES.md`
- current source paths named in `05_GAP_REGISTER.md`

The current Bimax worktree was not modified outside `docs/product-reset/` by this research pass.

## Owner sections 28 and 29 platform research

The deep primary-source ledger, architecture decisions and journey contracts are centralized in
`../11_SECTIONS_28_29_RESEARCH_AND_DELIVERY_PLAN.md`. It covers Apple Endpoint Security, System and
Network Extensions, FSEvents, code signing/notarization, SIP/SSV/XProtect, provenance-based anomaly
research, ExtensionFoundation/XPC, TUF/Sigstore/SLSA/OSV, Agent Skills/MCP, Xcode and Android
simulators, Virtualization, MLX/Core ML/PyTorch MPS, ProcessInfo/memory/network signals, Metal frame
policy and Reduce Motion.

These sources support Targets and constraints, not competitive Wins. No rival comparison or broad
security/performance claim was added from this research.

## Model Context Protocol provider boundary

Accessed 2026-08-09. These current first-party sources guided Phase 4's engine/Desktop seam:

| Source | What it supports |
|---|---|
| [MCP 2026-07-28 tools specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/docs/specification/2026-07-28/server/tools.mdx) | `tools/list`, `tools/call`, JSON Schema inputs, structured content and list-change capability |
| [MCP architecture](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/2026-07-28/learn/architecture) | host/client/server roles and local stdio process lifecycle |
| [TypeScript SDK client documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/blob/main/docs/client.md) | dynamic discovery/calls through the official client rather than provider-specific engine imports |

The retained local contract is
`app/benchmarks/computer-use/contracts/mac-provider-tools.sample.json`. This supports a bounded
local provider claim only; it is not evidence of a general extension marketplace or remote MCP
security model.

## Complete owner-vision research map

`../12_ALL_VISION_SECTIONS_RESEARCH_PLAYBOOK.md` maps all 37 distinct owner-vision chapters to
primary leads, algorithms, examples, falsification experiments and search prompts. New source areas
include Apple Metal device/working-set capabilities, ProcessInfo power/thermal state, responsiveness
and MetricKit, Network path, Homebrew/Python/Xcode/Docker structured environment sources,
Tree-sitter/LSP/Git editing contracts, OSWorld 2.0 and visual-grounding research, OpenSSF/OSV and
package-confusion research, and algorithm-selection/autotuning literature.

The map is an implementation-research index. It does not establish a competitor comparison,
Product-ready capability, or Win.

## Phase 5 frontend reset — interaction and accessibility sources

Accessed 2026-08-09, before any Phase 5 code was written. The existing research already carried the
product-level references (`../03_PRODUCT_EXAMPLES.md`, `examples/REFERENCE_MATRIX.md`); what it did
not carry was current first-party guidance for the two shapes Phase 5 actually builds — a
projects/tasks sidebar and a contextual evidence inspector — nor for the motion constraint.

| Source | Retrieved | What it supports | What it changed in the implementation |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Apple HIG: Sidebars](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sidebars) (page dated 2026-06-08) | 2026-08-09 | a sidebar navigates "areas of your app or top-level collections of content"; no more than two levels of hierarchy; group with disclosure; let people hide it but not by default; **"avoid putting critical information or actions at the bottom of a sidebar. People often relocate a window in a way that hides its bottom edge."** | The six implementation tools left the sidebar (they were panels, not collections). It is now exactly two levels: project → task threads, grouped Current/Earlier. Trust Center is reachable from the title bar and ⌘⇧T as well as the sidebar row, because the old build had Support and Settings only at the bottom edge. |
| [Apple HIG: Split views](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/split-views) | 2026-08-09 | first-party precedent for an inspector pane beside a main canvas (Keynote); set sensible min/max pane sizes so the divider stays visible; **"provide multiple ways to reveal hidden panes"** — toolbar button or menu command including a keyboard shortcut; prefer the 1pt thin divider | The evidence inspector is a resizable pane with declared min/max (300–56%) rather than an icon rail plus a dock. It has a title-bar toggle, a close control and ⌘J; every lane also has a palette entry. Dividers stayed 1pt. |
| [ChatGPT: Computer Use](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/computer-use) | 2026-08-09 | the current shipped competitor states which app is being controlled, keeps an always-allowed list, documents scoped background macOS work, and promises **"you can stop the task or take over your computer at any time"** | Confirms the Live Target contract is table stakes, not a differentiator: app + exact window, background/foreground per action, and a takeover control that is always reachable (⌘⇧P, task header, inspector). Bimax's addition over this is the per-action end-state receipt and the evidence age. |
| [MDN: prefers-reduced-motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) | 2026-08-09 | `reduce` means minimise non-essential motion — the vestibular triggers are "scaling or panning large objects"; the documented approach is to **replace** motion with a muted alternative, not to delete all feedback | `styles.css` previously set `animation: none` plus `transition-duration: 0.01ms !important` on everything, which removed state feedback entirely. Transform-based entrances now collapse to a short opacity fade and only continuous decoration stops. |

Stored material: `../examples/PHASE5_FRONTEND_REFERENCES.md` records the observations and the
decision each one drove. Deterministic renderer artifacts live at
`app/benchmarks/ui/results/phase5/` (journey reports) and `app/benchmarks/ui/screenshots/`
(supported-window-size regression images). The same results folder also stores distinct
`electron-*` records for the built Electron main/preload/supervisor/compiled-provider boundary;
their native target is an explicitly named safe fixture, not a live-app performance sample.

These sources support interaction and accessibility decisions only. No competitive Win, and no
performance or hardware claim, is derived from them.

## Phase 7 macOS release hardening

Accessed 2026-08-09 before changing the release path. These are platform constraints, not evidence
that the current artifact passed them.

| Source | What it supports | Implementation consequence |
|---|---|---|
| [Apple: Notarizing macOS software before distribution](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing-macos-software-before-distribution?changes=_5) | Developer ID signing precedes notary submission; a successful result produces a ticket that can be stapled | Stable script signs/submits/staples the app before constructing and submitting/stapling the DMG. A local signature is not called notarization. |
| [Apple: Resolving common notarization issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/resolving-common-notarization-issues) | valid Developer ID Application identity, secure timestamp, hardened runtime, and no debug-only entitlements are baseline requirements | Stable path refuses missing/mismatched nested Developer ID teams and verifies the hardened bundle before upload. |
| [Electron: Security checklist](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security) | context isolation, sandboxing, restricted navigation/new windows, sender validation, and narrow permission handling remain release requirements | Phase 7 preserves the existing security boundary and adds only a no-argument, user-save-dialog export. |
| [Electron: Context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/context-isolation) | expose narrow methods rather than raw `ipcRenderer` | Export is one typed method; filesystem/process authority stays in main. |
| [Electron: Updating applications](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/updates) and [autoUpdater API](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/auto-updater/) | macOS auto-update requires a signed application | Manual alpha gets a verified transactional manual installer; signed update remains a stable Target. |
| [Electron: Process sandboxing](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/sandbox) | sandboxed renderers move privileged work behind IPC | Diagnostic assembly/writing stay in main and renderer receives only `saved/cancelled/failed`. |

Stored local evidence: `../evidence/phase7-local-2026-08-09.json` and
`../18_PHASE7_RELEASE_HARDENING_RECORD.md`. It supports a local arm64 manual-alpha candidate only,
not a public release, Intel build, clean-Mac result, stable channel, or competitive Win.

## Trust Center, native drag and motion hardening

Accessed 2026-08-11 before changing the Trust Center, permission coach, model catalogue and shared
dialog/button motion. These are current first-party platform and interaction constraints; they do
not establish fresh-Mac TCC success or a competitive Win.

| Source | What it supports | Implementation consequence |
|---|---|---|
| [Apple HIG: Designing for macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-macos) and [Settings](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/settings) | Mac utilities should expose clear hierarchy and native platform behavior; settings describe user-adjustable app choices, while macOS privacy grants remain system-owned | Trust Center reports live, responsible-host permission readings and opens the exact System Settings pane; it never draws fake grant switches. Required Control Mac grants are separated from optional access. |
| [Apple HIG: Sheets](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sheets) | Modal work should be focused and avoid unnecessary depth or prolonged nested interaction | Trust Center and Model catalogue each have one fixed header, one scrolling body and one fixed footer. The nested two-scrollbar Trust Center was removed. |
| [Apple HIG: Motion](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/motion) and [Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility) | Motion should clarify state and feedback, remain brief and coherent, and provide a reduced-motion alternative | Dialogs use short opacity/scale entrances, buttons use bounded press feedback, and Reduce Motion removes sheen/scale in favor of opacity feedback. No permanent decorative loop was added. |
| [Apple HIG: Drag and drop](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/drag-and-drop) | A drag source should be visibly draggable, the destination should remain clear, and a non-drag alternative should exist | The compact coach names the exact tile, keeps System Settings as the visible destination, supplies Back to Bimax, and never substitutes a fake toggle for a macOS grant. |
| [Electron: Native File Drag & Drop](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/native-file-drag-drop/) and [`webContents.startDrag`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/web-contents#contentsstartdragitem) | A native drag begins in the main process and the drag item requires a file path plus a non-empty icon on macOS | The permission coach resolves the exact responsible host/service bundle and guarantees a non-empty generated raw-bitmap icon before starting the native drag. The main sheet hides so it cannot cover System Settings. A local 2026-08-11 crash report showed `app.getFileIcon()` trapping in AppKit `NSImage` on Electron 43.3.0/macOS 26.5.2, and a 2026-08-12 packaged run showed SVG/PNG data URLs decoding empty, so native/file/codec icon lookup was removed from this path. These are local observations, not broad Electron compatibility claims. |
| [Electron: `BrowserWindow`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-window) | Window show/hide/focus and always-on-top behavior are main-process responsibilities | Electron main owns the permission-coach window choreography and restores Bimax only when the coach closes or the user chooses Back. |
| [Apple: Keychain Services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain-services) and [Electron: `safeStorage`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/safe-storage) | Passwords and keys belong in protected credential storage; on macOS Electron's encrypted storage key is kept in Keychain | Provider API keys are encrypted in main, persisted with private filesystem modes, decrypted only for engine spawn, redacted from IPC recordings, and never sent on NDJSON. |

Local evidence: `app/src/main/__tests__/manual-alpha.trust.test.ts` and the fully green/mutation-aware
renderer record `app/benchmarks/ui/results/phase5/run-2026-08-11T16-02-32-205Z/report.json` (including
J4, J9, J10, J11 and the model-gating J12). Exact-hash local approval is an alpha bridge only: it neither proves builder
identity nor bypasses Accessibility, Screen Recording or any other macOS permission.

Local follow-up evidence, 2026-08-12: the user-controlled `Bimax Drag Verified` native drop reached
System Settings, followed by
`~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Bimax Drag Verified-2026-08-12-002835.ips` (`SIGTRAP` during
AppKit application reopen) and bounded coach lifecycle logs. The corrected local build passed J4
with M1–M5 rejection, the 64×64 raw-bitmap Electron smoke, 3 focused suites / 9 tests, production
build and strict deep ad-hoc verification. This is a local regression record, not a new external
source and not evidence for clean-Mac TCC, Developer ID, notarization or Product-ready status.
