# Installing BiMax safely — integrity, signing, and trust

This page is for anyone installing BiMax and for the operator cutting a release. It explains exactly
what is verified, how to verify it yourself, and the current signing status. The website's install
page should link here.

## What the installer guarantees

The one-line installer (`curl -fsSL https://<host>/install | bash`) is **transactional and
fail-closed**:

1. Downloads the platform tarball and the `SHA256SUMS` manifest to a temporary directory.
2. **Verifies the manifest's signature** against a public key pinned inside `install.sh` itself
   (not a key fetched next to the artifacts). If a signature is present it MUST verify or the install
   aborts.
3. **Verifies the tarball's SHA-256** against the (now-trusted) manifest. A mismatch aborts.
4. Extracts into an isolated scratch dir and installs **only** the exact expected binary name.
5. **Atomically replaces** the existing binary and smoke-tests `bimax --version`. If the new binary
   can't run, it **rolls back** to the previous version. A failed update never leaves you broken.

Nothing partially verified is ever executed, and the old binary is preserved until the new one runs.

## Verify a download yourself

```bash
# 1. checksum (always available)
shasum -a 256 bimax-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
grep bimax-darwin-arm64.tar.gz SHA256SUMS      # the two hashes must match

# 2. signature over the checksum manifest (when SHA256SUMS.minisig is published)
minisign -Vm SHA256SUMS -P "$(cat bimax-minisign.pub)"
```

The pinned public key also lives in `install.sh` (`MINISIGN_PUBKEY`). Trust is rooted in the script
you already chose to run, so a compromised release host that swaps both the tarball and its adjacent
`SHA256SUMS` still cannot forge a valid signature.

## macOS: signing, notarization, and the "no warning" question

Fetching a CLI with `curl | bash` does **not** attach the quarantine flag a browser download gets, so
the absence of a Gatekeeper prompt is **not** evidence that a binary is signed or safe. Verify signing
explicitly:

```bash
codesign --verify --strict --verbose=2 "$(command -v bimax)"   # signed? hardened runtime?
spctl -a -vvv -t install "$(command -v bimax)"                  # Gatekeeper assessment
```

### Release operator — signing the CLI binaries

`release.sh` signs the darwin binaries when a Developer ID identity is available:

```bash
export MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
export BIMAX_MINISIGN_SECKEY="$HOME/.minisign/bimax.key"   # signs SHA256SUMS
./release.sh darwin-arm64 darwin-x64 linux-x64 linux-arm64
```

Without `MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY` the build still succeeds but prints an UNSIGNED warning.

### Release operator — notarizing the desktop DMG

Code signing (`codesign`) is **not** notarization. Notarization is an Apple-side scan; only a
successful notarization + stapling clears Gatekeeper on a clean Mac. Do not claim notarization from a
local `codesign` pass.

```bash
# 1. Build a signed, hardened app (app/electron-builder.yml already declares hardenedRuntime +
#    entitlements). Provide the cert + notarization credentials via env:
export CSC_LINK="/path/DeveloperIDApplication.p12"
export CSC_KEY_PASSWORD="…"
export APPLE_ID="you@example.com"
export APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD="abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="TEAMID"
# In app/electron-builder.yml, remove `identity: null` and uncomment the `notarize` block, then:
cd app && npm run build && npx electron-builder --mac

# 2. If notarizing manually instead of via electron-builder:
xcrun notarytool submit BiMax.dmg --apple-id "$APPLE_ID" \
  --password "$APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD" --team-id "$APPLE_TEAM_ID" --wait
xcrun stapler staple BiMax.dmg

# 3. VERIFY ON A CLEAN MAC (a machine that never built it):
spctl -a -vvv -t install BiMax.dmg      # must say "source=Notarized Developer ID"
xcrun stapler validate BiMax.dmg
```

**Current status:** the CLI archives are checksum-verified in the private source workflow, archived
as CI artifacts, and promoted to the separate public binary repository without exposing source.
Independent minisign signing and macOS Developer ID signing/notarization are *wired* (config +
release hooks above) but activate only when the signing credentials are supplied. The v1.0.4 macOS
builds are published as an explicitly unsigned beta; verify the attached checksums.

## Uninstall — what each tier removes

```bash
install.sh --uninstall            # removes the executable only
install.sh --uninstall --purge    # also removes ~/.breakglass (your API keys)
```

Per-repo `.bimax/` project data is **never** touched by the installer — it is yours (and may be under
version control). Remove it manually if you want it gone.

## Your API key on disk

BiMax stores your provider key at `~/.breakglass/.env`, created `0600` inside a `0700` directory
(owner-only). On every startup BiMax re-tightens these modes, migrating any older permissive install,
and refuses to follow a symlink planted at that path. See `src/cli/env.loader.ts`.
