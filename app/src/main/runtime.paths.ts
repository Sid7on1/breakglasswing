/**
 * Where a packaged Bimax.app is allowed to find its own executables.
 *
 * `05_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md` is explicit: "a release build cannot walk to `../src` or silently
 * compile whichever engine happens to be beside it", and `08_ACCEPTANCE_GATES.md` requires that
 * "compatibility/legacy backends cannot silently activate in a production build". Before this
 * module, both were violated by the same two habits:
 *
 *   1. every component honoured an environment override FIRST, unconditionally — so launching the
 *      packaged app with `BIMAX_CU_SERVICE_BINARY=/tmp/anything` pointed the shipped product at a
 *      foreign native service, and `BIMAX_ENGINE_CMD` replaced the engine outright;
 *   2. a missing bundled engine fell through to `dist/index.js` and then `npx tsx src/index.ts`
 *      resolved from a walked-up repo root — a packaged app quietly running source it did not ship.
 *
 * The rule is therefore: **packaged runs resolve from the bundle and nowhere else.** An override
 * presented to a packaged app is not obeyed and not silently dropped either — it is reported, so a
 * refusal is visible in the engine log rather than looking like the override "did nothing".
 *
 * Development keeps one explicit engine override for contributors. Its default is the same pinned,
 * staged engine artifact used by packaging — never an implicit dist/tsx source ladder.
 *
 * Electron-free by design: `app.isPackaged`, `process.resourcesPath` and filesystem probing are all
 * injected, so the whole policy is unit-testable without an Electron process.
