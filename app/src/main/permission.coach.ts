 * The permission drag coach.
 *
 * macOS's Accessibility, Screen Recording and Full Disk Access lists are add-by-drag: the most
 * direct way in is to drag the responsible bundle onto them. A first-time user cannot guess that,
 * so this floats a draggable Bimax icon over System Settings, exactly where the drop has to land.
 *
 * The overlay is a compact interactive drag source rather than a sheet-sized click blocker. We
 * previously tried to hand mouse ownership back and forth with `setIgnoreMouseEvents`; that race
 * made the icon intermittently impossible to grab. The window now occupies only the visible coach
 * tile, so the rest of System Settings remains directly interactive.
 *
 * The drag itself is a real native file drag of the app bundle (`webContents.startDrag`), which is
 * what System Settings accepts. We never claim to grant anything: macOS does the granting, and the
 * pane polls the true reading afterwards.
