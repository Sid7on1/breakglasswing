/**
 * What did the user just press?
 *
 * A seeded expansion needs the rect of the control that opened the surface. Passing that down by
 * hand works, and `useSeed()` exists for callers who can, but it means every one of the seven
 * dialogs (and every future one) has to thread a seed through its props or silently lose the
 * animation — the failure mode being "this one dialog fades and nobody knows why".
 *
 * So the trigger is observed instead. One capture-phase listener records the rect of the last
 * control the user activated; any surface opening shortly afterwards can claim it.
 *
 * ## Why not `document.activeElement`
 *
 * It is the obvious answer and it is wrong twice over. Radix moves focus INTO the dialog on mount,
 * so by the time a content component can read it the trigger is already gone — and a control
 * activated by mouse may never have taken focus at all. Recording the intent as it happens is the
 * only reading that survives both.
 *
 * ## Why freshness matters
 *
 * Not every surface is opened by a press. The engine raises approval prompts on its own schedule,
 * and a permission modal that appeared while the user was reading should NOT fly out of whatever
 * button they happened to touch a minute ago — that is a false claim about causality, and it looks
 * like one. Past the freshness window there is no seed and the surface plainly fades in, which is
 * the honest animation for "this arrived by itself".

 *   - `keydown` is the keyboard path; a pointer event never fires for Enter on a focused button.
 *   - `click` catches activations that produce no pointer event at all — assistive technology
 *     commonly dispatches a bare `click`, as does any code calling `element.click()`. Without it a
 *     screen-reader user gets the plain fade while everyone else gets the expansion, which is a
 *     worse outcome for exactly the people least served by a silent state change.
