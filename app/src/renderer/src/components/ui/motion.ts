/**
 * The motion system: springs, compiled to CSS `linear()`.
 *
 * ## Why springs and not more cubic-beziers
 *
 * A cubic-bezier is a shape. A spring is a *physical claim* — this surface has mass, it is being
 * pulled to a target, and it settles. The difference is only visible in one place, but it is the
 * place that matters here: the moment of arrival. An ease-out decelerates asymptotically into its
 * target and stops dead; a spring arrives with a little momentum left and settles it out. That
 * settle is the entire perceptual difference between "a box resized" and "a thing moved".
 *
 * Everything is compiled ahead of time into a CSS `linear()` easing, so the browser composites the
 * whole flight on the GPU — no per-frame JS, no jank when the engine is busy streaming tokens into
 * the transcript. The spring is a *design-time* solver, not a runtime one.
 *
 * ## Why the presets are graded by size
 *
 * A round button and a full window cannot bounce the same amount. Overshoot is perceived relative
 * to the surface: 5% on a 40px pill is 2px and reads as a crisp snap, while 5% on a 900px window is
 * 45px of visible rubber and reads as a toy. So `springFor()` takes the surface's diagonal and
 * grades the spring against it — one bounce character, progressively damped and slowed as the
 * surface grows, so a dropdown, the sidebar and a full sheet feel like the same material at
 * different sizes.
 *
 * ## Why presets are stiffness + damping RATIO, not stiffness + damping
 *
 * Raw damping is not a portable description of bounce: what a spring actually does is set by the
 * dimensionless ratio ζ = c / (2·√(k·m)), so the same `damping: 22` is springy under one stiffness
 * and dead under another. Grading by size through raw damping is worse than useless — raising mass
 * while holding `c` LOWERS ζ, which is how a "heavier, calmer window" config ends up bouncing
 * roughly three times as hard as the button that opened it. Presets therefore name ζ directly
 * (0.55 = visibly springy, 1.0 = no overshoot at all) and the solver derives `c` from it.
