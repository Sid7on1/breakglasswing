/**
 * The springs.
 *
 * Motion is the one part of a UI where "it looked fine" is not evidence: an over-damped config and
 * a springy one both produce a smooth animation, and the difference between them is a claim about
 * physics that nobody can read off a screen recording. So the physics is asserted directly.
 *
 * The specific thing these guard is the mistake that was in this file first: grading springs by
 * SIZE through raw damping. Raising mass while holding `c` lowers ζ, so a config meant to make big
 * surfaces calmer made them bounce roughly three times as hard as the button that opened them —
 * smoothly, plausibly, and completely backwards.
