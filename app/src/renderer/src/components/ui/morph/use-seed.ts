/**
 * The seed side: a control that can be measured *now*.
 *
 * v1 captured the trigger's rect at click time and kept it. That is correct for opening and wrong
 * for closing, which is a distinction the brief makes twice (Prompt 1 §22, Prompt 2 §25): between
 * the two events the window may have been resized, the sidebar dragged wider, the toolbar reflowed
 * into its overflow menu. A surface that folds back into a remembered rectangle flies, very
 * smoothly, to a place its button is no longer at.
 *
 * So a seed is a *handle*, not a value. The morph asks it where the control is at the moment it
 * needs to know.
 *
 * `../intent.ts` remains the fallback for surfaces that cannot hold a ref to their trigger — the
 * engine-raised approval prompts, and anything opened from a menu that has already unmounted. That
 * path deliberately returns null when no press was recent enough to explain the surface appearing,
 * because a modal that flies out of a button nobody touched is a false claim about causality.

/**
 * A seed handle backed by the last control the user actually pressed.
 *
 * For surfaces that have no way to hold a ref to their trigger — the engine-raised approval prompts,
 * the dialogs opened from a menu that has already unmounted, and the structural regions whose
 * triggers live in a different component tree entirely.
 *
 * ## It latches, and that is the whole design
 *
 * A press explains a surface *opening* only if it was recent (`INTENT_FRESHNESS_MS`), because a
 * modal that flies out of a button nobody touched is a false claim about causality. But a surface
 * that has been open for a minute still has to fold back into the control it came from, and by then
 * no press is recent. Re-reading the tracker at close time therefore gives null, and the panel
 * collapses into its own centre instead of going home.
 *
 * So the first fresh intent is *latched* — the element, not its rect — and re-measured on every
 * subsequent call. A newer press replaces the latch, which is what makes reopening the same surface
 * from a different control fly from the right place. This is Prompt 1 §15's `MorphOrigin` with the
 * rect left out: the rect is derived when it is wanted, never stored, so the trip home lands on the
 * control as it is now rather than as it was.
