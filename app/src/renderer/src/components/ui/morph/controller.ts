/**
 * The morph driver: five springs, one clock, one element.
 *
 * This is the piece that makes a Seed Morph a *physical* object rather than a scheduled animation.
 * It holds `(value, velocity)` for x, y, width, height and radius, and every frame it steps them
 * toward whatever the current target is. Nothing here has a timeline, an elapsed time or a
 * duration — which is precisely why every interruption in the brief (close mid-open, reopen
 * mid-close, resize mid-flight, switch to another seed) is handled by *changing a target*, with no
 * cancel, no restart and no special case.
 *
 * ## One clock for everything
 *
 * All live morphs step from a single rAF. Two reasons, and the second is the important one:
 *
 *   1. One callback instead of N.
 *   2. **The clock that writes the geometry is the same clock everything else is waiting on.** If a
 *      surface's box were driven from JS while its contents rode a compositor transition, a
 *      main-thread stall would freeze the box and let the contents keep sailing — they visibly come
 *      apart. This app stalls the main thread routinely, because it renders streaming markdown. One
 *      shared clock makes the tear impossible: a stall holds *everything* still, and the analytic
 *      spring then resumes through the correct point rather than from a stale one.
 *
 * ## Read, then write
 *
 * Prompt 1 §26. The tick performs no layout reads at all: geometry is state, so a frame is pure
 * arithmetic followed by a batch of style writes. Measurement happens only at the edges — when a
 * morph opens, closes, or is told the window changed — and each of those is a single read pass
 * before any write. There is no point in the frame where a read follows a write.
