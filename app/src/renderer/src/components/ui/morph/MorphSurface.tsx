/**
 * The React binding: one surface, driven by one controller, rendered on the overlay layer.
 *
 * This component owns three things and deliberately not a fourth:
 *
 *   1. **Lifetime.** `open` is the caller's intent; the surface stays mounted past `open === false`
 *      for exactly as long as the collapse takes, so it can fold home instead of vanishing.
 *   2. **The overlay layer** (Prompt 1 §24). Rendered through a portal to `document.body`, because
 *      the morph has to be able to cross any ancestor with `overflow: hidden`, any transform-created
 *      stacking context, and the panel columns' own clipping — all of which exist in this app's
 *      layout and any of which would silently amputate a flight.
 *   3. **Re-measurement.** A resize observer on the window and on the seed's own offset parent, so a
 *      window drag or a sidebar resize retargets the live spring instead of stranding it.
 *
 * What it does *not* own is focus semantics. A popover, a modal sheet and a structural region want
 * three different answers about focus traps, and baking one in would either over-trap the popovers
 * or under-trap the modals. `SeedPopover` (below) adds the popover answer; a modal composes this
 * with Radix's Dialog, which is already load-bearing elsewhere in the app.
