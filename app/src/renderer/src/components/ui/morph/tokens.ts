/**
 * Motion tokens, v2 — named by what they are for, not by how long they take.
 *
 * Prompt 1 §41 and Prompt 2 §95 both ask for the same thing and for the same reason: a duration
 * scattered across forty components is forty independent decisions that drift apart, and nobody can
 * answer "is this app's motion consistent?" by reading them. A token names an *interaction*, so the
 * question becomes "should a popover and an inspector feel the same?" — which is answerable.
 *
 * ## Why these springs are stiffer and better damped than v1's
 *
 * v1's morph used `glass` (k 340, ζ 0.70), which overshoots about 12% on a control-sized surface.
 * That is a good number for a design demo and the wrong one for BiMAX. Prompt 2 §6 is the
 * governing constraint: this is a pointer-driven Mac app, not a touch UI, and these controls get
 * clicked hundreds of times in a working session. Apple's guidance is that indirect input should
 * get the more subdued response — an overshoot you notice on the first click is one you resent by
 * the hundredth.
 *
 * So every morph token sits at ζ ≥ 0.82: present as a settle, absent as a bounce. The springiness
 * the brief asks for is still there, in the sense that matters — the surface arrives with momentum
 * and resolves it, rather than decelerating asymptotically and stopping dead. It just resolves it
 * in about two pixels.
 *
 * The values are a starting point tuned against the physics, not received wisdom; the Motion Lab
 * exists to move them (Prompt 1 §41: *do not blindly use arbitrary numbers*).

 * The spring for a surface of a given size, travelling a given distance.
 *
 * Two corrections, for two different complaints:
 *
 *   - **Size.** Overshoot is perceived as a fraction of the surface. 3% of a 40px pill is one pixel
 *     and reads as a crisp snap; 3% of a 900px window is 27px of visible rubber and reads as a toy.
 *     So ζ climbs toward critical as the surface grows. Stiffness falls at the same time, because a
 *     large surface that arrives as fast as a button reads as weightless however little it bounces.
 *   - **Distance.** Prompt 1 §29: 20px and 700px should not use an identical curve. But Prompt 2 §8
 *     immediately fences this in — *optimise for perceived immediacy, never animation spectacle* —
 *     so the distance term is small by design. A long flight gets 12% more time, which is enough to
 *     read as a longer journey and not enough to make the user wait for it. Scaling duration with
 *     distance the way a physical simulation would is exactly how a 700px morph becomes a 900ms one.
 *
 * Both terms are clamped, so a 5K display does not produce a spring that takes two seconds, and both
 * are flat below control size, so a 12px badge is not a special case.
