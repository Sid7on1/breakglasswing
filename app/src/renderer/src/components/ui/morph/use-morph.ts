/**
 * The lifecycle half of a morph, once.
 *
 * Three surfaces in this app own their DOM differently — `MorphSurface` portals a shell with a
 * content layer sized to the destination, `MorphRegion` leaves its content in the layout and flies
 * an empty shell over it, and `ui/dialog` has to let Radix own the node so the focus trap stays
 * real. What none of them differ on is the *lifecycle*: build one controller and keep it for the
 * surface's whole life, open and close by retargeting rather than restarting, re-measure when the
 * world moves, paint every frame, and stay mounted until the collapse has actually finished.
 *
 * That was written out three times before this hook existed, which is precisely the "duplicate
 * animation systems" Prompt 1 §36 warns about — not three animation *engines* (there is one), but
 * three chances for one of them to quietly stop calling `remeasure`, or to unmount a surface that
 * is still flying, and for the difference to show up only on the surface nobody re-tested.
 *
 * The caller keeps its elements and its markup. This owns the controller.
