/**
 * The write half of a frame: turn a `MorphFrame` into element styles.
 *
 * Split out from the driver so the physics can be graded without a DOM, and so there is exactly one
 * place that knows which CSS property carries which part of the geometry. That mapping is fussier
 * than it looks and getting it wrong produces animations that are smooth and wrong:
 *
 *   - Position rides the **`translate` property**, not `transform: translate()`. The individual
 *     transform properties (`translate`, `rotate`, `scale`) compose with each other, so the
 *     deformation can own `scale` without either of them having to know the other exists. Packing
 *     both into `transform` means every writer has to reconstruct the whole matrix, and whoever
 *     writes last silently wins.
 *   - Size rides real `width`/`height`, which is the entire point of v2 (see ./geometry). The
 *     surface is `position: fixed` and `contain: layout paint`, so this lays out the surface and
 *     nothing else — no ancestor reflow, and its own subtree is fixed-size and merely clipped.
 *   - The corner rides real `border-radius` in px, so it interpolates honestly instead of being an
 *     ellipse smeared by a scale.
