/**
 * The geometry a Seed Morph is made of.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and window-coordinate based. That is deliberate: the morph's whole claim
 * is "this control became that surface", and a claim about two rectangles is only checkable if the
 * rectangles are values rather than side effects of a layout pass. The driver (./controller) does
 * the measuring and the writing; this file does the arithmetic, and the tests grade it directly.
 *
 * ## Why (x, y, width, height) and not (centre, scale)
 *
 * The obvious encoding of a shared-element transition is FLIP: lay the destination out at its final
 * size, invert it onto the seed with a transform, play to identity. It composites beautifully and it
 * is what Seed Morph v1 did. It has two defects that cannot be patched:
 *
 *   1. **The corner is a lie.** `border-radius` is resolved before the transform, so a 22px radius
 *      on a box scaled by (0.07, 0.4) paints as a 1.5×9px ellipse. The radius cannot be interpolated
 *      honestly under a scale, which is why v1 hard-coded `999px → 22px` and let it distort.
 *   2. **Content has to be counter-scaled** to survive, and a counter-scale is a resample: glyphs
 *      get re-rendered at a non-integer scale for the whole flight.
 *
 * Animating the box's real geometry fixes both — the radius is just another number in px, and the
 * content inside is never transformed at all. It also buys the anchoring the brief asks for (§6) for
 * free: with `x` and `width` as independent springs, a seed to the LEFT of its destination has a
 * left edge that travels 200px while its right edge travels 660px. The near edge stays visually
 * hooked to the source without anyone writing a rule that says so. Under centre+scale both edges
 * move symmetrically and the effect has to be faked with `transform-origin`.
 *
 * The cost is layout per frame on the morphing element. It is bounded: the surface is
 * `position: fixed` with `contain: layout paint`, so it has no in-flow siblings to reflow and its
 * own subtree is laid out at the destination's size once and then merely clipped.
