/**
 * A menu that is its own trigger, grown.
 *
 * This is the first real surface migrated to Seed Morph v2, and it is deliberately a *menu* rather
 * than something more spectacular. Prompt 2 §72 names the model selector as the flagship case, and
 * the reason it is a good flagship is that it is boring and frequent: a control the user hits dozens
 * of times a session, where any motion that draws attention to itself becomes an irritation by the
 * tenth use (§6, §105). If the morph survives being *ordinary*, it will survive anywhere.
 *
 * Compared with the anchored `../dropdown.tsx` it replaces:
 *
 *   - The panel is measured from the trigger's real rect and flies from it, rather than scaling out
 *     of a `transform-origin` corner. At a pill's scale those look similar in a still frame; the
 *     difference is that the corner trick has no idea where the trigger is, so it cannot travel, it
 *     cannot fold back into it, and it cannot be interrupted halfway.
 *   - It is portalled, so the composer strip's own clipping cannot amputate it.
 *   - The panel's corner is interpolated from the pill's, so the two read as one piece of glass.
 *
 * ## Keyboard
 *
 * Prompt 2 §33 is blunt about this: a beautiful morph is irrelevant if the keyboard path is
 * awkward. So the menu is a real menu — arrows move, Home/End jump, Enter and Space activate,
 * Escape closes and returns focus to the trigger, and the roving `tabindex` means Tab leaves the
 * menu rather than walking through it. None of that is new behaviour for the app; it is what the
 * dropdown should always have had.
