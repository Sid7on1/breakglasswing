// The Desktop Trust Center's view of the causal evidence timeline — Phase 8, owner section 28.
//
// This is the renderer-facing half of the shared vocabulary in `evidence.gen.ts` (generated from the
// engine's `src/evidence/schema.ts`; regenerate with `npm run gen:app-protocol`). It is a pure view
// model: it takes evidence records and produces rows the Trust Center renders, and it holds the line
// on the two things 08_ACCEPTANCE_GATES.md says the section 28 surface must never do.
//
//   1. "an evidence gap, dropped event or unavailable sensor cannot produce an unqualified safe
//      verdict" — so a row's confidence is derived here, and there is no way for a caller to hand in
//      a "clean" row whose evidence does not support it.
//   2. "deterministic hard floors, learned anomaly ranking and model explanation are separate in
//      receipts" — so a row keeps the layer and the model attribution apart, and the model's words
//      are carried in their own field that the UI labels rather than mixed into the finding text.
//
// The renderer never receives a native handle, an audit token, a raw path outside the project, or a
// secret: everything here comes from records the schema already validated and redacted.
