 *
 * Why this exists: a local checkout cannot produce `serviceSigned`, because

 * model already anticipates this case ("an unpackaged development binary reports
 * `service_not_signed`"); this makes the anticipated case reachable instead of merely described.
 *
 * What it does NOT do, on purpose:
 * - it does not touch the XPC client/ancestor checks. Those are separate and still enforced by
 *   `BimaxSignedAncestorAuthorizer`; a bridge still needs `BIMAX_CU_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_CLIENT=1`.
 * - it does not clear any capability blocker. `physical_input_unavailable`, capture and focus lease
 *   are measurements, and a forged environment variable must never be able to move a measurement.
 * - it is never implied by any other flag, and it defaults off.
 *
 * It is a real reduction in assurance: with it set, an unsigned binary of unknown provenance in the
 * expected path is trusted. That is acceptable for a developer running their own build on their own
 * machine, and unacceptable in anything shipped, which is why callers log it loudly.

 * the native path at all, however intact it is. This answers the SECOND question only, and asks the
 * user to stand in for the first.
 *
 * **Both conditions are required, and measurement on 2026-08-06 shows why neither is sufficient.**
 * A byte was flipped in the middle of a real ad-hoc binary:
 *
 *   - `signatureIntact` went `true` → `false` (`errSecCSSignatureFailed`, -67061). This is the check

 *   - `codeDirectoryHash` did NOT change. It is read out of the signature blob, not recomputed from
 *     the file, so it is a CLAIM the binary makes about itself. Alone it is forgeable.
 *
 * So `signatureIntact` proves the binary is unaltered since sealing, and `codeDirectoryHash` proves
 * it is the same seal the user approved. Checking only the hash would accept a tampered binary that
 * kept its blob; checking only intactness would accept ANY binary an attacker re-signed ad-hoc,
 * which anyone can do for free.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT establish is PROVENANCE. Nothing here proves who built the binary
 * — that is exactly the property Developer-ID provides and this cannot — so the approval prompt has
 * to say so plainly rather than implying the code was vouched for by anyone.
