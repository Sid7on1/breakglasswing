# Build a LOCAL, runnable Bimax.app on this machine.
#
# `npm run dist:mac` targets a release: it refuses a local engine and produces a hardened bundle for
# notarization. Neither is right for a build you intend to run here, and two failures on 2026-08-15
# proved it — both silent until launch.
#
#   1. HARDENED RUNTIME + A SELF-SIGNED CERT CANNOT RUN.
#      electron-builder.yml assumes "keyless local builds remain unsigned". Once the self-signed
#      "Bimax Local Code Signing" identity exists in the keychain that stops being true:
#      auto-discovery signs with it AND applies `hardenedRuntime: true`. Hardened runtime enforces
#      library validation, which requires every loaded library to share the process's Team ID — and
#      a self-signed cert has none. The app dies in dyld before any of its own code runs:
#        Library not loaded: @rpath/Electron Framework.framework/Electron Framework
#        ... (non-platform) have different Team IDs
#      Hardening only exists to enable notarization, which a self-signed build can never obtain, so
#      it is turned off here rather than defeated with disable-library-validation — that entitlement
#      would weaken the real Developer ID release too.
#
#   2. THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY MUST NOT BE INSIDE ICLOUD.
#      This repo lives under a synced Desktop. The file provider stamps `com.apple.FinderInfo` and
#      `com.apple.fileprovider.fpfs#P` onto bundle DIRECTORIES as it syncs, and `codesign` rejects
#      them outright ("resource fork, Finder information, or similar detritus not allowed"). It
#      re-applies them faster than a pre-signing sweep can strip them, so the only reliable fix is
#      to build somewhere unsynced. scripts/after-pack.cjs still clears what it can.
#
# Release builds are unaffected: they use dist:mac, a Developer ID identity, and stay hardened.

#
# THE ENGINE IS AN INPUT TO THIS BUILD, NOT A STEP OF IT.
#
# The desktop app embeds the `bimax` CLI as its engine, but it consumes it as a finished BINARY and
# never as source. This build therefore does not compile the CLI, does not cd into its tree, and
# does not care how it was produced — it takes a path to an executable and stages it. Whoever owns
# the CLI owns building it.
#
# An earlier version of this script compiled ../src/index.ts inline. That made a CLI build a step of
# the desktop build: the app could not be built without the CLI's source checked out and its
# toolchain (bun) installed, and a CLI-side break surfaced as a desktop packaging failure. One
# product, one build.
#
# Where the binary comes from, in order:
#   1. BIMAX_ENGINE_LOCAL_OVERRIDE — an explicit path you supply.
#   2. ../.engine-local/bimax-engine — where the CLI's `npm run build:engine` puts it.
#   3. engine.lock.json's pinned release — the release path, over the network.
#
# (3) is currently broken and is why this ordering matters: the lock pins v1.1.0 of
# Sid7on1/bimax-releases and that release was never published — the repo stops at v1.0.8, which also
# uses the older per-platform tarball scheme rather than the manifest scheme the lock expects. The
# download 404s, and because GitHub returns 404 for "asset missing" and "no permission" alike, it
# reads as an auth failure and sends you hunting for a token you do not need.
#
# Release builds are untouched: they set BIMAX_RELEASE_BUILD=1, under which
# resolve-engine-artifact.mjs refuses an override outright and (3) is the only path.
